### ```ft_print_memory``` is a memory dumping function, it takes a memory address and a number of bytes to read and produces a similar output:

each line is 16byte of data; the first byte address in the line, bytes in form of hex grouped by two, and same bytes in ASCII form.

##### ps: the code "obviously" doesn't respect the 42 norms;
## TODO:
- code cleanup for norms.
- split ft_print_memory to stay within 25 lines per function
