```ft_print_combn``` was a function I encountered in day C00 as a final exercise to required to aqcuire a full 100 pts.

It was a little bit of challenge to figure out how to solve it. unlike its sisters ```ft_print_comb``` and ```ft_print_comb2```, they all had the same concept but diffrent way to operate;
- print a combination n of digits without repition of same digit in a combination, for example: a valid combination of 3 digits is 123, non valid ones are 001, 557 
-  also number to the right must always be greater than the one to the left, for example: a valid combination of 2 is 12, non valid ones are 11, 10, 98.
